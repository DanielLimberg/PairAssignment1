# Test of statistical significance
# Difference in means test
teeth$supp <- as.factor(teeth$supp)

OJ <- teeth[temp,]$len #supplement 'OJ'
VC <- teeth[!temp,]$len #supplement 'VC'

## The 60 pigs become separeted in two groups according to the supplement they were given.
## Both groups are put into an object.

t.test(OJ, VC)

## A difference in means test is conducted to see whether the difference between the two groups is stat. sign.
## The propability that the Null is true is 6.1%. That means that the Null cannot be rejected.

rm(temp, OJ, VC)

# Chi square test
teeth$len2 <- cut(teeth$len, c(0,12,19,25.2,40))
teeth$len2 <- as.factor(teeth$len2)
## Tooth lenght is divided into four groups.

tbl <- table(teeth$dose, teeth$len2)
chisq.test(tbl)
## Chi squ test to see whether there is a statistical sign. relationship between the dose and the length.
## The result p<0.05 indicates that there is a sign. relationship between the dose and the group of length.

rm(tbl)
