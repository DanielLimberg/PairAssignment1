##Mean of each Variable except supply (nominal)
```{r teeth}
for (i in 2:3) {
  teeth[, i] %>%
    mean() %>%
    round(digits = 2) %>%
    paste(names(teeth)[i], ., "\n") %>%
    cat()
}
```
The mean for each variable shows that there is nothing special.


##Mean Length of Teeth for each Treatment 'OJ' and 'VC'
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
tapply(teeth$len, teeth$supp, mean)
```




```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
