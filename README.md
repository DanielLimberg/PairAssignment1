#Pair Assignment 1: Tooth Length of Guinea Pigs & Nasa Climate Data
*Mueller, Lukas & Limberg, Daniel*
This folder contains materials for the first Pair Assignment of the Collaborative Social Science Class '16 at the HSoG.

##Description of Datasets and Variables
We investigated on two quite different datasets of R's pre-installed ressources. The **ToothGrowth** and the **Nasa** datasets. While the first datasets contains information on the effect of vitamin c on tooth growth of guinea pigs, the later one provides spatio-temporal data for Central America by the NASA. 

##Guide to R code
In this folder we provide five key R scripts. We load both datasets and all necessary packages in our basic script **Y2_SS_Collaborative_PairAssignment.R**. In the second step we seperate our investigation into a Descriptive Statistics"" and a Joint Distributions part for both our datasets. The later files are linked to the Descriptive Statistics files - which are then both linked to our basic script.
The ToothGrowth dataset is investigated in **PairAssignment1_DescriptiveStatistics_ToothGrowth.R** and **PairAssignment1_JointDistributions_ToothGrowth.R**. 
The Nasa dataset is investigated in **PairAssignment1_DescriptiveStatistics_Nasa.R** and **PairAssignment1_JointDistributions_ToothGrowth.R**.
